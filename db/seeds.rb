Only later were trigonometric concepts defined strictly in terms of right triangles without the use of circles. So, to make the most sense out of trigonometry, it seems only natural for us to take that same approach. To do so, we will use the fabulous “unit circle” to enable us to conceptualize the six basic trigonometric functions."},
